## Purpose of the Analysis

The purpose of the Analysis is to present specific data visualization of different Bike Trip elements in order to prepare a proposal for a bike-sharing program in Des Moines. In order to complete this analysis, *Python's Pandas library* was used to create a datetime datatype which was then utilized in *Tableau* to generate a set of visualizations supporting the Des moines project for a bike-sharing program.

## Results

In order to understand different components of the project, several visualizations are created to emphasize the relationship between different data elements. These include:

- The length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
- The number of bike trips for each hour of each day of the week
- The number of bike trips for each type of user and gender 
- The peak hours for the month of August 2019
- The average trip duration 

### Checkout Times for Users 

The data on the graph below indicates the checkout times for users for August 2019, during which bikes were more likely to be rented for a period ranging from 2 to 15 minutes.


### Checkout Times for Users by Gender 

*The checkout times by gender* was illustrated by graphing the trip duration by hour and the gender of the riders. As shown below, Male riders constituted a majority of bike riders and their checkout time period is estimated between 2 and 12 minutes. On the other hand, Female riders chekout time is between 2 and 16 minutes while the unknown category of riders biked on average for 12 minutes. 


### Trips per Weekday Per Hour

The following graph shows that the busiest hours for bike trips are 8 am, 5 pm and 6 pm. Relatively, the busiest days are Saturdays and Thursday between 5 pm to 7 pm.


*The Weekday Per Hour Trips by Gender* show that the most active hours for male and female riders remain between the range of 5 pm to 6 pm. Male riders are also more likely to rent bikes than female riders.
