## Purpose of the Analysis

The purpose of the Analysis is to present specific data visualization of different Bike Trip elements in order to prepare a proposal for a bike-sharing program in Des Moines. In order to complete this analysis, *Python's Pandas library* was used to create a datetime datatype which was then utilized in *Tableau* to generate a set of visualizations supporting the Des moines project for a bike-sharing program.

## Results

In order to understand different components of the project, several visualizations are created to emphasize the relationship between different data elements. These include:

- The length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
- The number of bike trips for each hour of each day of the week
- The number of bike trips for each type of user and gender 
- The peak hours for the month of August 
- The average trip duration 

### Checkout Times for Users 

The data on the graph below indicates the checkout times for users for August 2019, during which bikes were more likely to be rented for a period ranging from 2 to 15 minutes.
